This project simulates the behavior of pack robots traversing an unknown environment under the constraint of wireless communication. Robots are bounded by a communication range. A stochastic methodology for determining movements is modeled after a formula derived by Rooker and Birke in their paper "Multi Robot Exploration Under the Constraints of Wireless Networking." The project was done for an Intro to Artificial Intelligence class, in which broad instructions were provided to imitate Rooker and Birke's methodology with room remaining for creativity. Graphstream was utilized to display the project simulation.
